# Loan-Portfolio-Analysis-Using-ML

This project will investigate the application of machine learning techniques for loan performance prediction on Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform. The study will utilize the Prosper loan dataset, containing borrower information and loan attributes.

An initial step will involve employing a Random Forest classifier to perform feature selection and identify the features that most significantly impact the model's loan status prediction. This process will involve training the Random Forest model and analyzing the feature importances. Feature importances quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. By examining the feature importances, we can gain valuable insights into which attributes are the most influential in determining loan status. Visualizing these feature importances will allow for an easy-to-understand representation of the relative influence of each attribute on the model's decision-making process.

Following the feature analysis, a Logistic Regression model will be constructed and evaluated. The model's performance will be assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. To address potential class imbalance issues, the effectiveness of oversampling techniques like Random Oversampling (ROS) and SMOTE on model performance will be investigated. Classification reports will be generated to analyze the model's behavior for both majority and minority classes.

To gain deeper insights into individual predictions, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), will be employed. SHAP summary plots will be utilized to visualize feature contributions across all test instances. LIME explanations will be generated for specific cases, highlighting the features with the most significant influence on a particular prediction. By comparing SHAP and LIME explanations for the same instance, a comprehensive understanding of the model's reasoning process will be achieved.

Furthermore, a Random Forest Regression model will be implemented to predict borrower interest rates. The model's performance will be evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). A scatter plot will be generated to visually compare actual versus predicted interest rates.

Finally, a time series analysis using ARIMA will be conducted to forecast future loan performance trends. The model will be trained on historical borrower rate data and evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE). The forecasted borrower rates will be visualized to identify potential future trends in loan performance on the Prosper platform.

The findings from this project are expected to contribute to a better understanding of factors influencing loan performance on peer-to-peer lending platforms. These insights can be valuable for lenders in a number of ways. By understanding the key factors that influence loan performance, lenders can make more informed investment decisions. For example, lenders may be able to identify borrowers with a lower risk profile and prioritize these loan applications in order to maximize their returns. Additionally, lenders may be able to use these insights to develop more sophisticated risk assessment models, which could allow them to offer more competitive interest rates to borrowers with a strong credit history.

The insights from this project can also be valuable for borrowers seeking loans on peer-to-peer lending platforms. By understanding the factors that lenders consider when evaluating loan applications, borrowers can optimize their applications to increase their chances of successful funding. For example, borrowers may be able to improve their credit score, increase their stated income, or choose a shorter loan term to make their application more attractive to lenders. Additionally, borrowers may be able to use these insights to negotiate more favorable loan terms with lenders.
